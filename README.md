# temperature-profile-analysis

This repository is for data analysis.
The data is the result of the test of samples, osram product.
We need to analyze if the product is robust enough.

We do all kinds of test in a bunch of cycles, to see if the result is reliable and repeatable.

This repository will assist our engineer to analyze the raw data without manual calculation for each cyle.
This repository is able to automatically detect the irregular case, generate the summary of each cycle and the summary of the whole file.
